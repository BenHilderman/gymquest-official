# Lift AI (GymQuest)

> **Every post is a workout you can run.**
> Tap a post. Start the workout.

A full-stack, multi-platform fitness application built with SwiftUI and SwiftData. Real-time workout tracking, multi-provider AI coaching, RPG-style progression, and a social feed across iOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

## Positioning

**The one sentence**

> *Every post is a workout you can run.*

**The one-paragraph pitch**

> Lift AI is a social gym app where every shared lift is an executable session — tap "Try it →" and the app starts that exact workout, scaled to you. Friends, clubs, and the discover feed are the distribution layer; the runnable post is the product.

**Who it's for**
18–28 lifters who already post gym content (IG stories, TikTok PRs, Hevy logs) and have 2–5 training friends. They want the social feed Strava gave runners — but for the barbell, and with posts that are actually doable instead of photo blobs.

**The wedge**

| Competitor | What they ship | What they miss |
|---|---|---|
| **Hevy** | Clean logger + social feed, 10M+ users | Shared routines strip weights/reps — "the reps and weight will not be included" (their own docs). Structure travels, prescription doesn't. |
| **Strava** | Best-in-class social for cardio, 100M+ users | Gym is a blob called "Workout — 45 min." No lifter home at scale. |
| **Strong** | Minimalist personal tracker | Explicitly no social. |
| **Apple Fitness+** | Studio-style classes with Group Workouts | SharePlay requires synchronous FaceTime — async "train with friends" is empty. |
| **Fitbod / Juggernaut / Alpha Progression** | AI-generated or science-based plans | Solo. No peer UGC. |
| **12REPS (YC)** | Positions as "Strava of strength" | Coach-authored content, not peer-runnable posts. |

**No competitor ships executable-post as a first-class primitive.** That is the empty square on the board.

**North-star metric**
Taps-to-Try per post. Every feature is evaluated on whether it makes a workout easier to *spread*, not just easier to *log*.

## watchOS

Self-contained companion app with exercise GIF previews, Digital Crown weight adjustment, rest timer with gradient ring, workout history stored locally on-watch, and real-time iPhone sync via WatchConnectivity. Tracks heart rate through HealthKit workout sessions. Built with SF Rounded typography and a neutral palette matching Apple's native design language.

- Quick Start grid with Push, Pull, Legs, Upper, Lower, Full Body templates
- 4-tab active workout: exercise tracking, rest timer, exercise list, overview
- Local workout history persisted to UserDefaults (no SwiftData dependency)
- Completed workouts sync to iPhone via `transferUserInfo` for guaranteed delivery
- 160 bundled exercise GIFs with first-frame extraction via CoreGraphics

---

## Features

**Workout Engine** · Live set tracking with rest timers, haptic feedback, RPE logging, auto PR detection, ghost data from previous sessions, and milestone celebrations. Supports Push, Pull, Legs, Upper Body, Cardio, and fully custom splits.

**AI Coach** · Context-aware coaching powered by OpenAI, Groq (Llama 3.3 70B via LangChain), or Ollama for local inference. Falls back to a rule-based offline demo mode when no API key is configured. Onboarding chat flow builds a personalized training plan.

**Training Load Analytics** · Backend-computed ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio) and sRPE strain tracking with exponential weighting. Flags undertrained (<0.8), optimal (0.8–1.3), and injury-risk (>1.5) zones. Monotony tracking to detect repetitive strain patterns.

**Gamification** · 11 XP levels, quests with progress tracking, squad challenges, forgiveness tokens, fist bumps, momentum scoring, and comeback plans for returning users.

**Social** · Workout cards, coach takeaways, media posts with photo uploads, reactions, comments, pods (small accountability groups), squads, clubs with leaderboards, and a ranked discover feed.

**Form Studio** · Camera-based form checking with pose detection, 3D exercise viewer, video coaching generation, mastery tracking, and offline HLS downloads for exercise demos.

**Music Integration** · NowPlaying bar, album art service, music preview playback, and workout-synced song display.

**Health & Nutrition** · HealthKit integration for activity and workout sync, meal logging, body measurements, and a health dashboard.

**Integrations** · Strava and Whoop OAuth connections, Apple Watch real-time sync via WatchConnectivity, and deep link support (`liftai://` URL scheme).

**Design System** · `GlassCard`, `HeroCard`, `StatPill`, progress rings, gradient accents (`GQColors`, `GQGradients`), haptic patterns, and a consistent typography scale with `GQTypography`.

## Architecture

MVVM with singleton services. Views observe `@Observable` ViewModels and `@MainActor` services. SwiftData handles persistence with 55 `@Model` classes. Supabase provides real-time cloud sync, auth, and storage. Backend runs as a standalone FastAPI microservice for AI coaching and training load math.

## Database & Cloud

**Supabase** handles cloud persistence, auth, real-time sync, and file storage.

| Layer | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Auth** | Email/password signup, JWT (3600s expiry), Google Sign-In (OAuth) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 17 with row-level security |
| **Storage** | `post-media` and `profile-photos` buckets, 50MB file limit, S3 protocol |
| **Real-time** | Enabled for live feed updates |
| **Migrations** | 4 versioned SQL migrations (schema, storage policies, workouts, validation) |

Schema includes profiles, posts, reactions, comments, workouts, sets, exercises, training load, and server-side validation constraints on captions, comments, and usernames.

On-device, **SwiftData** persists all 55 model classes locally. Supabase sync is opt-in via feature flags. The app works fully offline.
